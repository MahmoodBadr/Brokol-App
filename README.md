## Inspiration
Have you ever felt frustrated or disappointed about throwing away grocery items that you have previously bought? Growing up in communities affected by food insecurities, the team felt personally compelled to work on a project to tackle this issue from the household's point of view. We want consumers to visualize their money savings and environmental impact from reducing food waste, while promoting food security with our app. 

## What it does
Brokol empowers users to manage their food purchases and reduce food waste in an intuitive and fast way. This is done by allowing users to scan receipts which automatically allows the user to save, organize, and manage their food purchases. This helps users to know what they have, what they need, and what may expire in addition to allowing them to track their purchases.

## How we built it
We built Brokol using the Swift programming language, UIKit, X-Code, and the vision framework in IOS which contains within it Apple's machine learning tools for image and text optical character recognition.

## Challenges we ran into
Among the difficulties we ran into was properly creating pattern recognition for the text from the receipts after scanning.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our implementation of the receipt scanner and its ability to detect relevant text information so that it can be stored for organization and management.

## What we learned
Within the Apple ecosystem we learned about the vision framework in IOS and more about the Swift programming language. Additionally, we also improved our understanding of machine learning, text optical character recognition, and image and pattern recognition.

## What's next for Brokol App
The team aims to take this project to the market. By analyzing the problem and possible users, we have decided that the early customer segments to tackle are moms and young families in Canada. We want to provide a tool for those who have to worry the most about the consumption of groceries process in their households.
